I am so glad to start to play week of code contest again. It is hard to go back since it is not easy to play contest. I need to sacrifice and will easily get into the fight against timeout and other issues. 

Here is the result:

I started to work on the contest in the morning of Sunday June 24, 2018. I could not get full score for first three algorithms since I missed the weekday time. Also I did not have any time to read problem statement for hard level, expert level algorithm. 

Here are two blogs I wrote for the contest just 20 minutes before the contest ended.
