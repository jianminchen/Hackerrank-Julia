# Hackerrank-Julia
I like to check in source code for all contests I have played and also algorithms I have practice. Get organized and review them. 

Here is my hackerrank profile: https://www.hackerrank.com/jianminchen_fl?hr_r=1

I am the fighter, no matter win or lose. I like to get hardest fight and then try to solve hard level algorithm after the contest. 

Through the contest, I solved partially expert level algorithm and also hard level algorithm. It is very good practice and I like to continue to work on the algorithm once I have a few hours break. 

Plan to check in all 20 contests I played. At first, I will check in those 10 contests with medals. 

1. Gold medal (so ar up to June 20, 2018, 1 Gold medal)

I have to push myself hard to play contests and try to get another gold medal.
