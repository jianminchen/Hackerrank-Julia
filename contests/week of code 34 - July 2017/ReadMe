I started the week of code late in Friday, I only had chance to work on two algorithms. 

Here is my results: https://www.hackerrank.com/results/w34/jianminchen_fl

Here is my comparison to the ranking No. 1:

Surprisingly, the medium algorithm "Maximum Gcd and sum" I worked on is very tough since my score is 3.25 out of 25. I plan to work on the algorithm when I have one hour break.

Here are the blogs I documented my play:
