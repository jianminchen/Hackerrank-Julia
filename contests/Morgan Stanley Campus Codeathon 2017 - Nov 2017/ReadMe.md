I played the contest until the last moment. I did enjoy the contest, and I documented my play through coding blog:

I spent time after the contest to study various submissions on the algorithm: Order Strings. 

Preparation is very important to play very well on the contest. Work on the problems early, give myself time to develop good ideas and thoughts. Do not wait last minute since it addes me extra stress. 

I love the contest, I will come back to play more in short future. 

I love this blog to document my exeprience:
