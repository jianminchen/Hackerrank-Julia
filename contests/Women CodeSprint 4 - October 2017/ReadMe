I like to share the blog I wrote for the contest. Here is the link:

Extra sweet is the medium level algorithm, I only scored 4 out of 30 in the contest. It is sad that I did not have time to work on other algorithms in the contest. I was busy to work on mock interviews at that time. 

It is a good idea to review extra sweet algorithm, and try to write a correct solution first.
